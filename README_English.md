# üì¶ Brazilian Export Mapping (2022 - 2025)

üìÑ [Vers√£o em portugu√™s](README.md)

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing Brazilian exports from 2022 to 2025, based on public data provided by the federal government. Using a combination of tools such as MySQL, Python, and Power BI, the solutions were developed for importing, modeling, and interactively visualizing the data, with a focus on logistical and commercial insights.

## Objective
Analyze the behavior of Brazilian exports by answering the following key questions:
- Which URFs (Brazilian Customs Units) handle the export processes?
- What are the main types of goods exported by state?
- What are the top destination countries for Brazilian exports?
- Is there seasonality in the monthly cargo export flow?

## Tools Used
- **MySQL**: Storage, structuring, and creation of optimized SQL views.
- **Python**: Automation of massive CSV file imports into MySQL.
- **Power BI**: Database connection, Power Query transformations, DAX metrics, and dashboard development.

## Process Stages (ELT)
**1. Extract:**  
Raw export data was obtained from the official open data portal of the Brazilian government, provided in `.csv` format by the Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services.  

**2. Load:**  
The CSV files were first loaded into MySQL using a Python script that automatically detects new files and imports them into year-specific tables.  

**3. Transform:**  
Data transformations (joins, aggregations, calculations, and filters) were performed within Power BI‚Äôs Power Query, ensuring flexibility and ease of updates without altering the original database.  

**4. Visualization:**  
With the data prepared, KPIs, DAX measures, and visualizations were created in Power BI to answer the project‚Äôs key questions. The dashboard was then published for public access.

## Python Automation
A Python script was developed to automate the following tasks:
- Detect `.csv` files starting with `EXP_` in the Downloads folder.
- Create the corresponding table in MySQL (if not already created).
- Import the data using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`, ensuring fast performance.
- Run a `UNION` to append the new data to the consolidated table (`tb_exportacoes_unificada`).
- Rename the original file by adding the prefix `Importado_` (`Imported_`).
- Move the processed file into a folder called `Arquivos processados` (`Processed files`).
